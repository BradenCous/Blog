        <h2>Review from Coach Tommie Brenner of the UWEC Track & Field Team:</h2>

        <p>
         When first analyzing the webpage, I noticed the color scheme is complimentary of the Blugold Track and Field  teams’ colors. Having this relation to the school colors makes the page easily recognizable and relatable. The Fan Zone is dedicated to gathering information. By obtaining this information, coaches could identify their fan base, reach out with updates, and contact fans for donations to the team. Not only that, but it could help with future recruiting. When continuing to the home page, there is a link to the national results reporting site – which would allow fans to track the team and compare them to other teams. The gallery gives fans a first-hand look into the current athletes, their statistics, and meet locations. This page allows fans to view all of the current athletes’ best marks of All-Time. This makes it simple to track records and current standings.
