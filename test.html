    <h2>Week 1: Feb 17</h2>
    When hearing of the first project for CS 268, my first thought was to work with some of the data I track for the UWEC Track and Field teams. I do this in excel and thought it would be cool to embed a spreadsheet into the HTML. After doing a little digging I found that you can do this pretty easily with some functionality that is built into google docs (if you have your spreadsheet in google sheets). The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5SkbcId-v0">video</a> I watched explains how to get the sheet to embed in HTML code using iframe. Google sheets makes it pretty easy to get the correct snippet of code for the spreadsheet!
